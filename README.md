## About Me :wave:

Hey there! :smile: My name is Zuber, I'm a Xamarin.Forms Developer and Consultant from Pune, India. I've completed Bachelors Degree at [Pune University](https://zealeducation.com/), and I'm looking to help those that need mobile app development work done, or searching for ideas and management for their next content project.

I would also love to volunteer my time to contributing to open-source projects! I love creating and tinkering with small, static apps and projects.

I'm always looking to work with people that are hopeless idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating and working on cool, interesting, and meaningful projects! Shoot me [**an e-mail**](mailto:zuber1234@gmail.com) if that sounds like your cup of tea üçµ.
